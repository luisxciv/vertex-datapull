# vertex-datapull


#Summary 
I have a mysql table which holds information about user's travelling routes.
A route is sent in an array to the server every time the device is unlocked and the coordinate pairs are picked up 
individually by the device every 3 minutes(while locked)

The individually picked coord-pairs (AKA the vertices) are stored as ```report_dates``` and the array of a travel route 
is stored as ```created_date```

Using a sql group function I can order the data in such fashion as: 
```
report_date             created_date          lat             long    
'2018-07-23 12:50:17','2018-07-23 13:24:07','20.61172005','-100.40829606'
'2018-07-23 12:56:17','2018-07-23 13:24:07','20.61167437','-100.40831555'
'2018-07-23 13:27:25','2018-07-23 13:30:37','20.61167177','-100.40827577'
'2018-07-23 13:47:08','2018-07-23 14:19:02','20.61169680','-100.40826807'
'2018-07-23 13:50:08','2018-07-23 14:19:02','20.61170654','-100.40832073'
'2018-07-23 16:36:19','2018-07-23 16:59:29','20.56082257','-100.41531155'
'2018-07-23 16:44:01','2018-07-23 16:59:29','20.55179966','-100.42291697'
'2018-07-23 16:49:29','2018-07-23 16:59:29','20.55411145','-100.42070601'
'2018-07-23 16:52:29','2018-07-23 16:59:29','20.55753864','-100.41818360'
'2018-07-23 16:55:29','2018-07-23 16:59:29','20.56269359','-100.41385984'

 ```
I can identify a total of 3 routes by grouping the ```created_date``` column and calculate speed on every group's vertices using  ```v=d/t```. We can also filter out 
repeated/null information from within Mysql or pandas.

Calling API's like Overpass and HereMaps can also help us identify street names, speed_limits, street_types and other insightful data.

I decided to iterate and do this process for every id in a list and insert the results back into a sql table.
